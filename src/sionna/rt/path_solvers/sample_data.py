class SampleData:

    Class used to store shoot-and-bounce samples data

    A sample is a path spawn from a source when running shooting and
    bouncing of rays. However, to distinguish these paths from the ones stored
    in a :class:`~sionna.rt.PathsBuffer`, which are further processed and/or
    returned by the solver, the paths spawn during shooting and bouncing of rays
    are referred to as "samples".

    Each sample can lead to the recording in a :class:`~sionna.rt.PathsBuffer`
    of one or more paths.
